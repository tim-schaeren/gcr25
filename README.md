# GCR25

This is a project i wrote for my friends.

It's a scavenger hunt game that let's gamemasters set up players, teams, quests and items. Players can solve quests, use items and try to win the game by being the first team to complete the hunt.

The app consists of two main parts. The admin-space that lets gamemasters set up a game, and the user-space that lets players compete in the game.

GCR25 is written in React with Vite as a local dev server. Once pushed to the repo, the code is built and deployed by Netlify. Under the hood I use Googles Firebase for databasing, storage and auth and Google Maps' JavaScript API for maps.



## Features

- Registering and waitlists
- Users and auth
- Teams, team-colors and more
- Quests, including images and videos
- Geolocation for quests and Players

- Shop to buy items
- Items like 'curse' that slow down other teams or boost your own team
- and much more
